## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd churn-prediction-system

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Integrated Dashboard

```bash
# Launch the complete Streamlit application
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`

### Dashboard Workflow

The integrated dashboard provides a complete 4-tab workflow:

1. **Data Upload & Preview** - Select or upload datasets, view data summary
2. **Data Preprocessing** - Configure and apply data cleaning and encoding
3. **Model Training & Evaluation** - Train multiple models, compare performance
4. **Predict Churn** - Make real-time predictions with business recommendations

## System Architecture

### Integrated Streamlit Application

The primary interface is a comprehensive Streamlit dashboard (`app/streamlit_app.py`) that integrates all functionality:

- **Session State Management**: Maintains data and model state across tabs
- **Real-time Processing**: Live data preprocessing and model training
- **Interactive Visualization**: Dynamic charts and performance metrics
- **Model Persistence**: Automatic saving and loading of trained models

### Reference Modules

The `src/` directory contains modular reference implementations:

- **data_preprocessing.py**: Standalone data cleaning and preprocessing
- **feature_engineering.py**: Advanced feature creation algorithms
- **model_training.py**: Multi-algorithm training and evaluation
- **evaluation.py**: Comprehensive model assessment and visualization
- **report_generation.py**: PDF report generation capabilities

These modules serve as reference implementations and can be used independently for custom workflows.

## Key Features

### Automatic Dataset Detection
The system automatically identifies whether you're using:
- **Telco Dataset**: Uses columns like `CustomerID`, `MonthlyCharges`, `Contract`
- **Bank Dataset**: Uses columns like `CustomerId`, `Geography`, `Balance`

### Feature Engineering Pipeline
Creates powerful predictive features:

| Feature Type | Examples | Business Value |
|--------------|----------|----------------|
| **Tenure Buckets** | Short/Medium/Long | Identify at-risk new customers |
| **Service Counts** | Total services used | Cross-selling opportunities |
| **Payment Types** | Online vs Offline | Payment method optimization |
| **Customer Segments** | High-value, At-risk, New | Targeted retention strategies |
| **Interaction Features** | Tenure × Charges | Complex relationship modeling |

### Multi-Model Training
Automatically trains and compares:
- **Logistic Regression**: Fast, interpretable baseline
- **Random Forest**: Robust ensemble with feature importance  
- **XGBoost**: State-of-the-art gradient boosting

### Dashboard Features
- **Real-time Predictions**: Interactive customer churn prediction
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track model metrics and accuracy
- **ROI Calculator**: Calculate retention campaign profitability
- **Visual Analytics**: Comprehensive charts and business insights

- **Campaign Cost**: $150 per targeted customer
- **Customer Lifetime Value**: $1,200
- **Retention Success Rate**: 35%
- **Expected ROI**: 200%+ over 12 months

### Actionable Recommendations
1. **Contract Incentives**: Promote annual contracts with discounts
2. **Payment Optimization**: Encourage automatic payment methods
3. **New Customer Programs**: 90-day onboarding initiatives
4. **Proactive Retention**: Target high-risk customers early
5. **Value Communication**: Better articulate service benefits

## Deployment Options

### Local Development

### Cloud Deployment
The system is ready for deployment on:
- **Streamlit Cloud**: Direct GitHub integration
- **Heroku**: Web application hosting
- **AWS/Azure**: Enterprise cloud deployment
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment

### API Integration
Easy to integrate into existing systems:
```python
# Load trained model
import pickle
with open('models/churn_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model_package = pickle.load(f)

# Make predictions
model = model_package['model']
prediction = model.predict(customer_data)
probability = model.predict_proba(customer_data)[0][1]
```
